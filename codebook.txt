


1. Acquire the dataset

The dataset is downloaded and unzipped into a directory named UCI HAR Dataset.

2. Load the data into variables

features <- features.txt: 561 rows and 2 columns. These represent the feature names derived from raw 3-axis signals of accelerometer and gyroscope (tAcc-XYZ, tGyro-XYZ).

activities <- activity_labels.txt: 6 rows, 2 columns. Contains the activity labels and their corresponding codes.

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt: 2947 rows, 1 column. Holds the subject identifiers for the test set, representing 9 out of 30 volunteers.

x_test <- test/X_test.txt: 2947 rows, 561 columns. Holds the test feature data.

y_test <- test/y_test.txt: 2947 rows, 1 column. Contains the activity labels for the test data.

subject_train <- train/subject_train.txt: 7352 rows, 1 column. Holds the subject IDs for the training set, representing 21 out of 30 volunteers.

x_train <- train/x_train.txt: 7352 rows, 561 columns. Holds the training feature data.

y_train <- train/y_train.txt: 7352 rows, 1 column. Contains activity labels for the training set.

3. Combine training and test datasets into a single dataset

X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is formed by merging x_train and x_test using the rbind() function.

Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by binding y_train and y_test.

Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) results from merging subject_train and subject_test.

merged_data (10299 rows, 563 columns) is the final dataset after concatenating subject, Y, and X using cbind().

4. Extract measurements on mean and standard deviation only

columnsmeanandSTD (10299 rows, 88 columns) is derived from merged_data by selecting only the columns corresponding to subject, activity code, and those containing mean or standard deviation values.

5. Replace activity codes with descriptive activity names

The numeric codes in the code column of columnsmeanandSTD are replaced with the corresponding activity labels from the second column of the activities dataset.

6. Label dataset with more descriptive variable names

The code column is renamed to activities.

Abbreviations in the column names are expanded:

"Acc" → "Accelerometer"

"Gyro" → "Gyroscope"

"BodyBody" → "Body"

"Mag" → "Magnitude"

Prefix "f" → "Frequency"

Prefix "t" → "Time"

7. Create a new tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject

tidydata (180 rows, 88 columns) is generated by calculating the average of each variable grouped by subject and activity using summary functions.

The resulting tidy dataset is exported to a file named tidydata.txt.







































The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition.

1. Download the dataset
-Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

2. Assign each data to variables
-features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns. The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
-activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns. List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels).
-subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column. Contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed.
-x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns. Contains recorded features test data.
-y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns. Contains test data of activities’code labels.
-subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column. Contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed.
-x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns. Contains recorded features train data.
-y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns. Contains train data of activities’code labels.

3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set:
-X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function.
-Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function.
-Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function.
-Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function.

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable.

6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
-code column in TidyData renamed into activities.
-All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer.
-All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope.
-All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body.
-All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude.
-All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency.
-All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time.

7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
-FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
-Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
