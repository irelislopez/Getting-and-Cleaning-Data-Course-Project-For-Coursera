# CodeBook

This codebook describes the variables, the source data, and the transformations performed to create the final tidy dataset `FinalData.txt` as part of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones project.

---

## Source Data

The original dataset was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).

- Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
- Version: 1.0
- Files extracted from the archive: `UCI HAR Dataset/`

---

## Data Description

The dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope readings from a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) worn by 30 participants performing daily activities.

Each observation records sensor signals along the X, Y, and Z axes, which were pre-processed into 561 features.

### Activities Observed:

- WALKING  
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
- SITTING  
- STANDING  
- LAYING  

### Subjects:

- 30 volunteers participated, identified by numbers from 1 to 30.

---

## Files Used

- `features.txt`: Names of the 561 features.
- `activity_labels.txt`: Mapping from activity code to activity name.
- `X_train.txt`, `X_test.txt`: Feature measurements for training and test sets.
- `y_train.txt`, `y_test.txt`: Activity labels for each observation.
- `subject_train.txt`, `subject_test.txt`: Subject identifiers for each observation.

---

## Transformations Performed

The following steps were taken to clean and transform the data:

1. **Data Merging**  
   - Combined the training and test datasets using `rbind()`.

2. **Feature Selection**  
   - Extracted only the measurements related to the **mean** and **standard deviation**.  
   - Selected columns using `grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", ...)` to avoid variables like `meanFreq()`.

3. **Activity Labeling**  
   - Replaced numeric activity codes with descriptive activity names using `activity_labels.txt`.

4. **Variable Renaming**  
   - Made variable names more readable by applying the following substitutions:
     - `"Acc"` → `"Accelerometer"`
     - `"Gyro"` → `"Gyroscope"`
     - `"Mag"` → `"Magnitude"`
     - `"BodyBody"` → `"Body"`
     - Prefix `"t"` → `"Time"`
     - Prefix `"f"` → `"Frequency"`
     - `"mean()"` → `"Mean"`
     - `"std()"` → `"STD"`

5. **Tidy Dataset Creation**  
   - Created `FinalData`, a new dataset with the **average of each variable** for each **activity** and each **subject**, using `group_by(Subject, Activity)` and `summarise_all(mean)`.

6. **Export**  
   - The final tidy dataset was written to `FinalData.txt`.

## Variables in Final Dataset (`FinalData.txt`)

- `Subject`: Integer. Identifier of the volunteer (range: 1–30).
- `Activity`: Factor. Activity name performed (e.g., WALKING, SITTING).
- All other variables are numeric and represent the **average** of the corresponding mean or standard deviation feature for that activity and subject.

Example variables include:

- `TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanX`
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanY`
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerSTDZ`
- `FrequencyBodyGyroscopeMeanX`
- `TimeGravityAccelerometerSTDY`
- *(and so on for a total of 86 measured variables)*

---

## Notes

- Only features with exact matches to `"mean()"` and `"std()"` were included.
- This tidy dataset conforms to the principles of tidy data: each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.
